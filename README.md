# JWT NestJs backend template

This project is a template for a backend API built in Nest.js 10 that allows user authentication and session validation through JSON Web Token.

It can be used as a foundation for any project that requires user authentication.

This project uses `passport-JWT` and `passport-local` modules from `passport.js`.
